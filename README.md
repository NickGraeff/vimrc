# vimrc
This is just my own little configuration for vim. I use it solely while I'm developing on Linux. I clone it regularly when my VirtualBox OS crashes and I need to make a new one. I actually added an assembly syntax-checker (for yasm) to the Syntastic plugin so that while I was editing my assembly files in my Systems Programming class I didn't have to constantly exit out, compile, and link only to find out I had a syntax/compilation error. They actually have an asm and nasm syntax-checker, but not yasm. This was a great help in that class and definitely made things a lot easier on me. I might try pushing that to the official Syntastic repository one of these days. 

I've tried to hand this tool off to students in that class but they all get scared off because it's Vim. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
